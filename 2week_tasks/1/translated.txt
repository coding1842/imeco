An interesting fact about computers is that the first electronic computer, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was created in 1945. Weighing around 30 tons and taking up 1,800 square feet (about 167 square meters), ENIAC was an enormous machine by today's standards. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army during World War II, which required the manual rearrangement of its parts and cables for programming. Despite its cumbersome size and manual operation, ENIAC represented a monumental leap in technology, demonstrating the potential for electronic devices to process data at unprecedented speeds. This invention laid the foundational bricks for the development of the modern digital computer, leading to the advanced and compact devices we use daily, such as smartphones, laptops, and servers.
